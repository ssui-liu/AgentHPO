Thought: Describe your reasoning process
Action: Specify the action to take; valid actions are 'Final Answer' or {tool_names}
Action Input: Input for the action
Observation: Outcome of the action

Analyze the completed tasks and their outcomes. Propose a new task focused on unexplored hyperparameter spaces or 
optimization techniques to methodically reach the final objective. The task executor will adjust hyperparameters and 
run the training script. Ensure your proposed hyperparameters are distinct from those previously tested,

Based on the all above information, analyze the up to now finished task and their corresponding results. 
provide a new task that need to be completed by the task executor agent. The new task should aim to explore different 
hyperparameter spaces or optimization techniques that have not yet been tried, in order to systematically achieve the 
final objective. The task executor can only change the hyper-parameters and execute the training script, so directly 
provide the hyper-parameter settings. Remember, the new sub-tasks should not overlap with complete tasks (i.e., 
do not try the hyper-parameters that already tested before), and provide your answer with Final Answer.
